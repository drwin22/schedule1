## Disabilities

The Office of Access & Disability Resources (ADR) strives to provide holistic support to students with disabilities through collaboration with faculty and staff. The ADR office works to minimize barriers and ensure equitable access by offering:

reasonable accommodations
academic coaching and advising related to disability
education on assistive technology and inclusive design
All ADR staff participate in ongoing professional development and keep current with best practices in the disability field.

Colleges and universities do not seek out students with disabilities due to privacy laws. Colleges and universities generally do not provide accommodations until a student requests them. For this reason, it's important that you reach out to us. The ADR office will work with you to make sure you have the accommodations you need and will provide coaching on self-advocacy. The ability to advocate will benefit you in your life and career.
